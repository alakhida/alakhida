# Hey there, I’m Alakhida 👋  

🎓 **42 Common Core Graduate** — just wrapped up one of the most intense and rewarding journeys of my life.  
💼 Currently looking for an **internship** to put my skills to the test, learn from real-world challenges, and grow into a better developer.  

---

## 🛠️ My Toolkit

- 🐧 **Linux** & **Bash** — my daily comfort zone.  
- ⚙️ **C & C++** — from low-level memory management to object-oriented design.  
- 🐳 **Docker** — building, shipping, and running apps in containers.  
- 🎨 **Frontend** — HTML, CSS, JavaScript with an eye for aesthetics.  
- 🖥️ **Backend** — just enough to wire things together and make it work.
